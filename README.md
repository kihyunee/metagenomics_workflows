# metagenomics_workflows

This repository was made to be a place where I can share tutorials, including commands, scripts, and workflow explanation, mainly with my colleagues. 

It will look more like a blog than normal github repositories... but if a stranger finds anything useful (!) for herself/himself here there's no problem just use anything.
